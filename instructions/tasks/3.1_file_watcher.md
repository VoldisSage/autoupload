# Task 3.1 – File watcher: get last OBS recording file

## Description
Implement a utility that returns the most recent video file created in the OBS recordings directory, based on modification time.

## Definition of Done
- A file `src/services/fileWatcher.ts` exists with:
  - `async function getLastRecordingFile(): Promise<string | null>`
- `getLastRecordingFile`:
  - Reads the directory specified in `obs.recordingsPath` from config.
  - Filters for video file extensions: `.mkv`, `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.flv` (case-insensitive).
  - Sorts by last modified time descending.
  - Returns the full path of the most recently modified video file.
  - Returns `null` if no matching files are found.
- Errors are handled gracefully with meaningful error messages.

## Tests
- Create `dev/testFileWatcher.ts` that:
  - Calls `getLastRecordingFile()` and logs either:
    - `Last file: <path>` if found.
    - Or `No recording files found` if null.
- Add npm script:
  - `"dev:test-files": "ts-node dev/testFileWatcher.ts"` or equivalent.
- Manual test:
  - Place 2–3 dummy video files in the configured recordings folder.
  - Run `npm run dev:test-files` and verify it returns the most recently modified file.

## Files to create / modify
- `src/services/fileWatcher.ts`
- `dev/testFileWatcher.ts`
- `package.json` (add dev test script)
